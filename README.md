Fever Font
==========

In an effort to reduce eye strain while reading articles in
[Fever](http://feedafever.com), I worte this tiny Chrome extension that increases
the font size for full article text only from 12px to 16px (or whatever you want).

Installation
------------

1.  [Download as zip](https://github.com/masnick/feverfont/zipball/master) and
    unzip.

2.  Modify the font size and line height in `feverfonts.css` as you see fit.

3.  Modify the URLs in `manifest.json` to match your own Fever installation.

4.  Go to the Extensions page in Chrome, click the "Developer mode" checkbox,
    then click the "Load unpacked extension..." button. Select the folder
    with `feverfont.css` and `manifest.json` in it.

5.  Navigate to your Fever installation. You should see a larger font size when
    you open the full text of an article.
